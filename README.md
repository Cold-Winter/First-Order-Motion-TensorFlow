# First Order Motion TensorFlow

This repository contains an implementation of the models from the paper [First Order Motion Model for Image Animation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00196.pdf) using **TensorFlow 2.0**. The original code uses **PyTorch** and you can find it [here](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model). This code still needs some fixes.

You can check my post called [Image Animation using a First Order Motion Model In TensorFlow](https://vincentblog.xyz/posts/image-animation-using-a-first-order-motion-model-in-tensor-flow), where I do my best explaining how this project works and all the things you need to know to fully understand the magic behind these models. Methods like **Taylor Expansion**, **Optical Flow**, and **Bilinear Interpolation** are explained in my post. like **Taylor Expansion**, **Optical Flow**, **Bilinear Interpolation**, etc.

This repository also contains a [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vincent1bt/First-Order-Motion-TensorFlow/blob/master/FirstOrderMotionModels.ipynb) where you can check the code divided by sections.
